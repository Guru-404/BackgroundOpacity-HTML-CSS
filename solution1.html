    <h1>Background Opacity</h1>
    <p>
      There is nothing called background opacity. Opacity is applied to the
      element, its contents and all its child elements, and this behavior cannot
      be changed just by overriding the opacity in child elements. Child vs
      parent opacity has been a long standing issue and the most common fix for
      it is using rgba(r,g,b,alpha) background colors. But in this case, since
      it is a background-image, that solution won't work. One solution would be
      to generate the image as a PNG with the required opacity in the image
      itself. Another solution would be to take the child div out and make it
      absolutely positioned.
    </p>
    <img
    src="overlay.jpg"
    alt="overlay-img"
    />
    <p>
      There is no background-opacity property in CSS, but you can fake it by
      inserting a pseudo element with regular opacity the exact size of the
      element behind it.
